1. Any "known issues" you had with the tutorial if you haven't fully completed it - if you did fully complete it, you can just describe any issues or challenges you ran in to while doing it.

Several times when working on this tutorial, Unity would crash because of a "burst" error and it not being compatible? I had to find my data in my temp folder because despite saving it would be corrupted on Unity hub after crashing. Beyond that, some of the tutorial that was strictly text based I had to do some meddling to find what parts I forgot to do. It took me over an hour to find out I forgot to add the UI Handler script to the UI Document game object, and that was breaking everything. A lot of the materials also didn't work due to conflicting names with stuff they already had in the assets folder, for example:
-They had their own scripts for collectibles to give health, areas to give damage, and player movement.
-Some of the assets wasn't in the correct folder so I had to move the images/animation controllers to a different folder.
- I couldn't find the 'fixed' animation for the enemies? At all? It wasn't in the animation folder with the rest of the options for some reason. Neither were the body images for the NPC, just the dialogue art?
Beyond this, I had troubles messing with the camera. I couldn't get it to work like how it would in 3D. Could you demo using the camera in Unity in class? 

2. The full name of all of your final project team members and a quick note about how things with your final project team are going - if you have any issues with your team, let me know here.  If you don't, you can just mention the name(s) of your teammates and tell me that things are going well.
My final project is with Jakeb Greig, we exchanged discord to communicate but haven't started on the final. The assignment this week (this one) didn't require collaboration so it was mostly dedicated to getting our own work done. 

Note that if you used any external assets this time around you should give credit to them just like every other time.

No external assets used outside of those provided in the Unity Asset Store for the Learning Tutorial.
